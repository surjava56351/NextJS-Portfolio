    description: "As an iOS Developer at Encoders, a software development firm specializing in e-commerce and custom solutions, I designed, developed, and optimized 3+ applications using Swift and Objective-C that served over [X] users. Over my three-year tenure, I led the full development lifecycle—from architecting scalable solutions to App Store deployments—resulting in a 30% boost in user engagement for key products. I engineered seamless integrations with RESTful APIs using Alamofire, cutting data latency by 25%, and implemented Firebase Analytics to monitor performance, reducing crash rates by 40% through targeted debugging. Collaborating with cross-functional teams in Agile/Scrum environments, I delivered iterative updates aligned with business goals while mentoring junior developers in Swift best practices and MVVM patterns. My work included performance tuning with Instruments and Core Animation, ensuring buttery-smooth UX for high-traffic apps like [mention notable app, if possible].

    description: "At CyberSWIFT, I specialized in building location-aware applications with robust offline capabilities, leveraging my expertise in both iOS (Swift, Objective-C) and Flutter frameworks. Over this intensive year, I architected and implemented advanced mapping solutions using MapKit, Google Maps SDK, and Mapbox—customizing overlays, clustering, and real-time GPS tracking for logistics and on-demand service apps. A key achievement was designing an offline-first database system using Realm and Core Data, enabling seamless synchronization and ensuring 100% functionality even in low-connectivity scenarios, which reduced user drop-offs by 35%. I also led the migration of a legacy iOS app to Flutter, unifying codebases while implementing Firebase Realtime Database for cross-platform data consistency. Collaborating with backend teams, I optimized WebSocket-based live location sharing, cutting latency by 50% for 10K+ concurrent users. This role deepened my expertise in geofencing, background location updates, and state management (Provider/Bloc in Flutter), while sharpening my ability to solve complex data synchronization challenges",
